# Halflife style for Textual

This is a [Textual](https://codeux.com/textual/) style is based on the built-in Simplified Dark style using colours from [Rainglow's Halflife](https://rainglow.io/preview/#halflife) by [Dayle Rees](https://daylerees.com/).


## Installation

Download or clone this project into the Textual Styles folder, then it should appear in Textual's Style preferences.


### Styles Location

Textual will look at one of two locations to locate custom styles.

A copy of Textual downloaded through the Mac App Store will look at the following path:

```
~/Library/Group Containers/8482Q6EPL6.com.codeux.irc.textual/Library/Application Support/Textual/Styles/
```

Otherwise, Textual will look at the following path:

```
~/Library/Group Containers/com.codeux.apps.textual/Library/Application Support/Textual/Styles/
```

This path can be easily opened in Finder by bookmarking the following URL: [textual://custom-styles-folder](textual://custom-styles-folder)

## Font

I love the [Fira Code](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code) font and recommend using that - but this style should work with any font you've chosen.
